Problem Statement: Online Book Store Application (MERN Stack)
Problem:
Traditional bookstores have limited accessibility, inventory management challenges, and lack personalized recommendations for readers. Customers often struggle to find books, compare prices, and make secure online purchases. Additionally, small bookstores lack an efficient platform to list, manage, and sell books online.

Solution:
A full-stack web application using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to browse, search, purchase, and review books while enabling store owners to manage inventory, track orders, and analyze sales.
